Task Manager Application

A project designed to fulfill the requirements of the "Programming in .NET Technology" course at the University of Economics in Wroc≈Çaw, this simple WPF application serves as a task manager. It features a user-friendly interface comprising buttons, combo boxes, and a DataGrid.

Key Features:
- **Task Management:** Allows users to add, update, delete, and save tasks.
- **Filtering Options:** Provides three types of filters based on time, priority, and status (complete or incomplete).
- **Adding Tasks:** Opens a new window upon clicking the "Add Task" button, where users can easily set task parameters and input text in the designated textbox.
- **Database Integration:** Utilizes Microsoft Access as the database backend, enabling SQL queries to manage data effectively.
- **Exception Handling:** Implements robust error handling to secure the application against various exceptions at all stages of operation.

This application not only meets academic requirements but also provides practical functionalities for managing tasks efficiently.
The Task Manager Application utilizes Microsoft Access as its backend database provider.
Ensure the appropriate version of Microsoft Access Database Engine is installed based on your system architecture (32-bit or 64-bit).
You can download the Access Database Engine from the official Microsoft website if it is not included with your Office installation.
If you encounter any issues during installation or operation, contact me at GitHub.
