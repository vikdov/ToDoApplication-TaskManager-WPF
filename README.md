Task Manager Application

A project designed to fulfill the requirements of the "Programming in .NET Technology" course at the University of Economics in Wroc≈Çaw, this simple WPF application serves as a task manager. It features a user-friendly interface comprising buttons, combo boxes, and a DataGrid. The app was created using C# for the back-end, XAML for the front-end, and SQL to send queries to the Access database.

### Key Features:

- **Task Management:** Enables users to add, update, delete, and save tasks directly within the application.
- **Filtering Options:** Provides three types of filters based on time, priority, and status (complete or incomplete) to organize tasks efficiently.
- **Adding Tasks:** Initiates a new window upon clicking the "Add Task" button, allowing users to define task parameters and input text in the designated textbox effortlessly.
- **Database Integration:** Utilizes Microsoft Access as the backend database provider, leveraging SQL queries for effective data management.
- **Exception Handling:** Implements robust error handling mechanisms to ensure application stability and security against various exceptions.
- 
### Installation:

Before installing the Task Manager Application, ensure the following prerequisites are met:
